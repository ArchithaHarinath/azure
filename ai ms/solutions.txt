9)move2childrentoright(c1,c2)

Question 3:

In online replanning before taking next step the current suituations are analysed and next step is taken 
SO it works the same as task 2 conditions. 
In conditional planning either the step taken will be successful or else the step taken is failed and redone.
So the conditions specified in task 2 will be enough to handle the suituation specified in the question because
it handles all the suituations.
So we dont have to change the conditions specified in task 2. 


Question 4:

After applying the action aaa(B,C) to S1 the resulting state is:
(A ttt1)
(B ttt1)
(C ttt1)
(ppp1 B C)
(ppp2 A)
(ppp2 B)
(ppp3 C)
(eee1 A C)
(eee1 B C)
(eee2 B)
(eee3 A)

Because of the action specified aaa(B,C) to S1 it deletes (eee2 C),(eee3 c) and adds (eee1 B C),(eee2 B)
to the State S1.

Question 5:
There are 4 predicates and each has maximum of 3 arguments and 5 constants.
upper bound:
The unique combination of constants are given by 5*4*3=60
So total the 4 predicates has 60*4 combinations
So the predicates combination can either be true or false 
The maximum limit of the predicates are 2^(60*4)or 2^(240)
lower bound:
Each predicate has 5 out of 1 constant as a argument.
So for 4 predicates it is 4*5=20
The unique combinations for each predicate is 2^20
